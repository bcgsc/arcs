	* Release version 1.2.1
	* Added `arcs-make` to `tar.gz`

2021-01-19  Theodora Lo <tlo@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.2.0
	* Users can now also use long reads to scaffold draft assemblies
	* Added `--arcs-long` and `--arks-long` modes to `arcs-make` so
	users can run the ARCS+LINKS pipeline using long reads as input
	  * `long-to-linked-pe` segments and assigns barcodes to the long
	  reads prior to running ARCS and LINKS

2020-01-08  Lauren Coombe <lcoombe@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.1.1
	* Users can now set the --pair parameter to output a tsv file with the
	number of links supporting each orientation (hh, ht, th, tt) of each
	scaffold pair
	* Bug fix to binomial test

2019-09-09  Lauren Coombe <lcoombe@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.1.0
	* Integrates 'ARKS' code (https://github.com/bcgsc/arks) into ARCS
	  * Now, can run ARCS in either default mode (using linked read
	  alignments) or ARKS mode (using exact k-mer mapping)
	  * added `--arks` mode to run in ARKS mode
	  * Updated `arcs-make` to specify in which mode to run the
	  scaffolding with linked reads
	* Bug fix to calculation of barcode multiplicity

2019-05-13  Rene Warren <rwarren@bcgsc.ca>

	* Big fixes
	* Improved documentation
	* Better input error handling

2018-07-31  Ben Vandervalk <benv@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.5.
	* Fix whitespace errors in makeTSVfile.py

2018-06-20  Shaun Jackman <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.4.
	* Do not trim lower-case characters from the ends of sequences.

2018-04-13  Shaun Jackman <sjackman@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version 1.0.3.
	* Use BX tag by default if present. The option `--bx` now has no effect.
	* Read the FASTA sequence lengths from the SAM header.

2018-03-12  Ben Vandervalk <benv@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version v1.0.2
	* added `--bx` option to parse Chromium barcodes from BX tag
	* fixed `makeTSVfile.py` for improved handling of distance
	estimates in LINKS v1.8.6 or later. The ARCS `--dist_est`
	option must be turned for distance estimates to be generated
	and used downstream by LINKS.
	* fixed incorrect default value of `--end_length` (0 => 30000)
	* fixed `--graph` option to output vertex declarations in
	same order as input FASTA (ABySS compatibility fix)

2017-12-04  Ben Vandervalk <benv@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version v1.0.1
	* added `--dist_est` option to estimate gap sizes
	  * distance estimations are based on number of shared Chromium
	  barcodes between neighbouring contig head/tail regions
	* added unit tests (`make check`)
	* added `--tsv` option to output graph in TSV format
	* added `--barcode-counts` option to output number of
	  reads per barcode in TSV format

2016-09-15  Sarah Yeo <syeo@bcgsc.ca>

	* Release version v1.0.0
